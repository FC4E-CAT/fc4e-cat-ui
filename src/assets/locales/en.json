    "overview": "Overview",
    "overview_text": "The main objective of WP2 is the creation of a Compliance Assessment Toolkit for EOSC: a set of concepts, implemented as a graph database and accessible via APIs, and supported by user interfaces via the APIs. The Compliance Assessment Toolkit will support the EOSC PID policy with services to encode, record, and query compliance with the policy. To do so, a wide range of compliance requirements ( TRUST, FAIR, PID Policy, Reproducibility, GDPR, Licences) will be evaluated as use cases for definition of a conceptual model. At the same time, vocabularies, concepts, and designs are intended to be re-usable for other compliance needs: TRUST, FAIR, POSI, CARE, Data Commons, etc. This will be followed by a supporting service specification (the framework), accompanied by development and testing of operational services for PID Policy Compliance monitoring. Though primarily aimed at machine-actionable operations, the API-based services will be complemented by user interfaces to broaden its use.",
