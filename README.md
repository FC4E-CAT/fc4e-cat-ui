The Compliance Assessment Toolkit will support the EOSC PID policy with services to encode, record, and query compliance with the policy. To do so, a wide range of compliance requirements ( TRUST, FAIR, PID Policy, Reproducibility, GDPR, Licences) will be evaluated as use cases for definition of a conceptual model. At the same time, vocabularies, concepts, and designs are intended to be re-usable for other compliance needs: TRUST, FAIR, POSI, CARE, Data Commons, etc. This will be followed by a supporting service specification (the framework), accompanied  by development and testing of operational services for PID Policy Compliance monitoring. Though primarily aimed at machine-actionable operations, the API-based services will be complemented by user interfaces to broaden its use. 
## Configuration

You can run:

 -  `npm start` . Runs the app in the development mode. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.
 -  `npm test` . Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.
 -  `npm run build`. Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.
 -  `npm run eject`. If you arenâ€™t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.
